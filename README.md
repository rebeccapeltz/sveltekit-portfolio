# Samples of Recent Work

I have been working as a Developer Instructional Designer and Curriculum Program Manager for Cloudinary for the last 3 years.  I have also been a part time student working on a MS in Instructional Design at Quinnipiac University.  I'll finish that degree in December 2022.  I started teaching full time in 2016.  The work I'll share here is from that time, so it's all open source.  I worked as a Software Engineer for many years before that that, but that work is not available for sharing.

## Periodic Table of Cloudinary Transformations

I worked on this as an assignment for school.  The idea is to produce a teaching aid for Cloudinary transformations using a familiar method of organiation - the periodic table used to organize element. This is coded in React.js.

## Cloudinary Training Material: Adding Images to a Next.js Project

In a recent webinar, where the theme was Cloudinary integration,  I prepared this Next.js starter portfolio to demonstrate how to add images using Cloudinary's React SDK's `AdvancedImage` component and Next.js's `Image` component.

## Student ID Application

I created a vanilla JavaScript app to demonstrate basic Cloudinary technology that can be done in the frontend, without needing to expose API secrets.  This application was developed as we went to online training mode only.  The idea was to create student ID badges, much like you would wear at an in person training, to share your name and company.

## Working with Cloudinary Video Player in React.js

I've really enjoyed learning how to work with Video in both the frontend and backend.  I wrote this article for the Cloudinary blogs and dev.to to help other devs see how to incoroporate video into their web pages using the React Framework.  This was written over a year ago, and I continue to refine how to work with video.

## Rich Media in a Product Gallery Widget

This app was created for a webinar on how to work with the Cloudinary product gallery.  I'm particularly proud of getting an example of Adaptive Bitrate Streaming video into one of the product galleries.  This was created using a Next.js starter with Typescript.
